The Day Just Passed
by Cal Day
----------------------------------------------------------------

I sit in my chair
And think about the day just passed
There was an urgency to be there
I did not want to fall last

I breath in cool air
And wonder at the day just passed
What moved me to care
How can I let it all go so fast

I have my peace
And feel amoung the day just passed
Work and play begin to cease
Yet I know while gassed,

I truly loved the day just passed
