A Way - by Cal Day
----------------------------------------------------------------

I want to need a way
A need is so real, if you need you must get
A want is so painful, if you want you lay uncomfortable, not ended

Why is it that I want a way
A way to keep going
A way to stop
A way to purpose
A way to a way

I want a way to be the way it is
A way would be the way it is
A way is the way it is
The way it is
